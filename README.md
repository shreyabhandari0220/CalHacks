# Instafit
# Inspiration
Instafit was created due to a gap in the current iOS Health and Google Health apps. While they provide health information, they lack any evaluation of the data for the user to actively take measures and more importantly be encouraged to take any measures. Instafit fills the gaps by providing users (the general population) with a real time evaluation of their health risks based on their health patterns (from the iOS Health or Google Health apps) and also leverages cryptocurrency as an incentive for exercising.
